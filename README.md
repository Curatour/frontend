CuraTour is an organizational scheduling app designed for Tour Managers of traveling entertainers. It is designed to work across device types and sizes for ease of use throughout a busy day, and includes functionality while in offline modes. Each user belongs to an organization, every organization can manage multiple tours. Within each tour, events are scheduled. These events may be concerts, press events, interviews, travel days, anything relevant for the tour. Each event can have an agenda for the day - a schedule for various parts of the day (load-in, sound check, doors-open, meet and greet, etc). Users can also manage pertinent contacts through the app, and use the app to connect directly to their contacts. CuraTour is here to make your life easier, and to help the show go on.
